        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 12, 1964, the son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Theodore Jorgensen. At the time of Jeffrey's birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student and his father was 19 years old.  After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April 1968. Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jeffrey, whose surname was then legally changed from Jorgensen to Bezos.

          Jeff Bezos attended a Montessori school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he was two years old. Jeff Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade. The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School.

          Bezos attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar, and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982. In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park". In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 GPA and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree (B.S.E.) in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[39][40] While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs. In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).

        <h3>Business Career</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          After Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust. He worked there from 1988 to 1990. He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a newly founded hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling in 1990 and worked there until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president at age 30.
        </p>
        <p>
          In late 1993, Bezos decided to establish an online bookstore. Bezos initially named his new company <em>Cadabra</em> but later changed the name to <em>Amazon</em> after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[51] At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[52] In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore. Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products. Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of other consumer goods. In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic. In October of 2013, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.  On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In February 2021, Bezos announced that in the third quarter of 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon, to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He will be replaced as CEO by Andy Jassy. In his final letter to Amazon shareholders, Bezos quoted geneticist Richard Dawkins: "Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at... If living things don't actively work to prevent it, they would eventually merge with their surroundings and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die."
